â€‹A prototype of an incremental game built for quarantine jam, a 48 hour game jam. 


The main jist of the game is that like other incrementals (Cookie Clicker, Candy Box), you have resources (money) and want to find out how to most efficiently, quickly, and effectively make your numbers go up.

There is currently no win condition within the prototype; try to become a millionaire, or assign your own profit goal. 

Mostly built to try a new genre and a new engine during a jam, may continue this project in the future, but it will require a lot of design and code refactoring before I really get into it.
